A simple and lightweight URL shortener made in PHP which allows users to shorten lengthy URLs and make them easier to share.

## Usage
To use this URL shortener, users simply need to submit the long URL they wish to shorten. Once submitted, the site generates a random string of characters that is used to identify the original URL and create a shortened one.

The shortened URL is then saved into a JSON file on the server, and a confirmation message is displayed to the user with the shortened link. Users can then share the shortened link with others, who can simply click on it to be redirected to the original URL.

When a user clicks on a shortened link generated by this URL shortener, the website checks the URL for the **link** parameter and the random string. If these parameters are present, the website redirects the user to the URL that was saved in the JSON file.
